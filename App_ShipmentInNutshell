We used AppSheet to create our application - Shipment in Nutshell.

 

What is AppSheet?

AppSheet is a free, user-friendly app developtment platform. It can be also created by the the business department to create custom mobile and web application without extensive coding knowledge. It offers a no-code or low-code approach, allowing users to build powerful apps by leveraging their existing data sources, such as spreadsheets or databases.

 

With AppSheet, users can visually design the interface and functionality of their applications through a web-based interface. The platform supports a wide range of features, including data synchronization, user authentication, workflow automation, and interactive forms. It also provides various templates and sample apps to help users get started quickly.

 

Welcome to Shipment in Nutshell

This is our Shipment in Nuthstell App.

Currently you are see two pages:

Irregularity Prediction
Event Tracking

 

Page - Irregularty Preciction:

Here you see an overview over predicted irregularities for status events, sorted by awb numbers.

If you click on it, you see the details of this shipment and this event.

For the irregularity prediction we have created a new event, called "DIS", which shows its probability based on the last status event.

 

Page - Event Tracking

In this event tracking board you see for each awb number the shipment in a nutshell, including:

Tracking event
Tracking event description
Irregularity Prediction
Planned DateTime
Actual DateTime
Estimated DateTime (for the event proof of delivery, POD)

 

In this app you are able to filter for certain criterias,

If you click on one status, then you get more information about this shipment. For example the depature and arrival location or the commodity.

In the detailed shipment overview you have the capability to upload shipment documents. Furthermore you can review documents, which were already uploaded.

 

 

Limitations

Due to the limit of time during this hackathon this application is a Proof Of Concept.
